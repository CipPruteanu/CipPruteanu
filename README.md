- 👋 Hi, I’m @CipPruteanu, Lecturer in Extreme Conditions Physics in the School of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh.
- 👀 I’m interested in high pressure physics, disordered materials, non-random mixing and solutions, data refinement, classical and ab initio simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently branching into machine-learning for interatomic forcefields.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on advancement of diffraction data refinement packages and their interfacing with quantum mechanical calculations.
- 📫 How to reach me: cip.pruteanu@ed.ac.uk
